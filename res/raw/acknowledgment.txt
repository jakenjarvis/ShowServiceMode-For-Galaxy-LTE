I avail myself of this opportunity to renew to everyone the assurance of my highest consideration.

・Mr. Y
Thank to contribute to the operation check on the SC-06D. And, I received to contribute to the information provided. If it were not for him, "Directly Call Activity" would not have been born.

・Mr. Toshi
Thank to contribute to the operation check on the SHV-E210S. If it were not for him, "SKT" would not have been born.

・Everyone of the inhabitants, 2ch SC-03D thread
Probably, I did not know existence of LTE, unless I looked at 2ch. And probably, ShowServiceMode did not exist. I also appreciate people using an old version (Ver1.0 and Ver2.0). 

・And you!
Thank you for using ShowServiceMode! Please continue to aid me.
